Get access to your blood glucose measurements from the popular CGM.

## prerequisits

The libreview app must be set up so that your readings are shared and you must have the libreview credentials.

## Howto

Use your libreview credentials to use `librelink.py` directly.

If you have an influxdb at hand, you can also copy `example.env` to `.env` and modify the parameters to fit your setup.

## Acknowledgment

All recognition belongs to https://github.com/timoschlueter/nightscout-librelink-up for pointing out how the API is working.
